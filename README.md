# PythonHelpers

A collection of simple Python functions and classes that I have written to accomplish various tasks. I intend to contribute to this repo over time as I discover Python code that I have written in the past or as I write new code for new projects. 

## NOTE: Deprecated

In the spirit of minimizing dependencies as well as separation of principles, I have split this repository up across several gists and repositories. In the past, I would install and include the entire repository just to include a handful of functions. I feel that the scope of this repository has become too broad, and with it the dependencies too broad, to make it practical to use. In the future, I do not intend to update this repository with any more code, preferring to include short functions and expressions in gists and more complex classes and functions in repositories with more focused scope.

## Installation

```
cd PythonHelpers
pip install .
```
